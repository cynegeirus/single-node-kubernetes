# single-node-kubernetes
This repository includes a Bash script designed to automate the setup of a single-node Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm`, `containerd`, and Docker on Ubuntu-based systems. It installs all required dependencies, configures system settings, and ensures container runtimes and Kubernetes tools are ready to use.
